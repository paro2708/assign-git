• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore while commiting a project into a repository.
A gitignore file in a Java project should contain files with extensions such as .jar, .war, .ear, .class, etc. 
If we do not add these extensions in the gitignore file, it will be difficult to figure out the actual files that need to be committed, 
since git status will show a long list of files with these dependencies included.

• What does fast-forward in git mean?
Fast forward in git means to move the main branch's tip to the end of the feature branch. If the current feature branch is ahead of the main
branch, instead of merging the two branches, we simply point the main branch to the current one. This prevents conflicts and is the easiest 
way to get the changes on the current branch onto the main branch.

• Why should you have different branches?
Each developer should create a different branch as it makes development easier. This way developers can isolate their work from others, and
add changes to their individual branches to make progress on their files. Finally these branches could be merged together into the main branch.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
It depends on the project. Most developers choose to have one repository per project, there is no hard and fast rule to this.
